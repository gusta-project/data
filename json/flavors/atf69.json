There is some brandy-ish booziness here, but I\u0026#39;m missing most of the caramel, barrel age, or vanilla you\u0026#39;d usually pick up there.

Seems closer to INW Brandy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s also something bitter here. Feels like it has just a hint of rubbing alcohol on top of that cognac booziness. Feels almost herbal. Sort of a light camphor warmth and almost a light pine taste. It could theoretically be a barrel char or something, but it isn\u0026#39;t quite clicking for me. It\u0026#39;ll kind of work as a smokiness for a couple drags and then go back to tasting just bitter and herbal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThinner flavor overall. Seems pretty top heavy with those boozy notes, but there isn\u0026#39;t much of a thicker base for anything to grab onto.

Doesn\u0026#39;t have much in the way of body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThroat Hit: Moderate. Decent boozy bite, but there is a some harsher bitterness to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePercentage testing: At 1%, this is light. Kind of a light booze and slight bitterness. No real body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 4%, the booziness is coming through a bit more but so is that bitterness. Nothing really deep, sweet, or even fruity. Still, no real body to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 8%, no more boozy but maybe more bitter. I can\u0026#39;t tell if this is supposed to be smokey or whatever, but it doesn\u0026#39;t really work. And again, fairly thin and a bit undersweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVape Train suggests mixing with this at 3-5%, and standalone from 5-10%. Just based on these tests, I\u0026#39;d probably use this as a lighter accent around 3% primarily for a light booziness and realizing you\u0026#39;ll have to work around the bitterness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUses \u0026amp; Pairings: I think this one might end up being fairly difficult to use. By itself, doesn\u0026#39;t really do a convincing cognac flavor. It\u0026#39;s kind of bitter and astringent to try to be using in a sweeter cognac type cocktail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause this doesn\u0026#39;t really have a fruitiness or heavy sweetness to this, you may be able to bend this one around a little bit. I can see using a bit of this with the right mix of apples and getting close to something like a calvados or even a pear brandy. The booziness is fairly accurate to a brandy style liquor and should blend fairly well if you wanted to work in your own fruit base. I think dialing in the percentages to step back from the worst of that bitterness might be a chore though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDoesn\u0026#39;t seem like a good choice for creams, custards, or bakeries.

Full Cotton Wicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTesting: Vape Train Guava, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 10 days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFlavor Description: Lightly funky and musky realistic guava with a sweeter guava nectar type body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGuava here tries to split the difference between sweet nectar and an actual fruit. The base of the flavor is relatively full and definitely has some of that sticky, full guava nectar type of body. Some light tartness helps set offset some of the heaviness, but still feels more like nectar. Not as full-on hawaiian punch \u0026quot;red\u0026quot; as some of the other guava options, and some fresher guava type top notes. My big dumb \u0026#39;murican palate reads this as sort of papaya-esque, with a softer, warmer tropical fleshy kind of vibe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe guava here is fairly musky. The room note is honestly just a bit strange, but there\u0026#39;s nothing really offensive when you\u0026#39;re vaping it. Light kind of ammonia vibe, but nowhere near as obnoxious as TPA Guava. Ripe tropical fruit kind of musk, can stick out a bit in busier mixes At higher percentages, starts to pick up a sort of vegetal finish. Somewhere between a piney mango peel and some of the muddy green notes on the end of passion fruit flavors. I almost pick up a bit of a minty cooling at 8%. Overall the off-notes are present, but not completely overbearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eModerately full mouthfeel here. Gets thick and a bit sticky at higher percentages. Almost has a light gelatin or gummy vibe closer to 8%. Fairly full-bodied sweetness. Not overtly candied, but the sweetness level feels closer to a guava nectar, and the tartness here doesn\u0026#39;t quite cut through those heavier sticky sweet notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy benchmark guavas are pretty much CAP Sweet Guava and FLV Pink Guava. This is definitely more realistic than CAP Sweet Guava, with a heavier musk and some funkier ripe guava notes. I\u0026#39;d say it mostly leans toward the same profile though, both having those heavier, sweeter guava nectar type notes. The top end of the VT Guava seems maybe a little more flat and less interesting than the terpene-ish citrus hops thing that FLV Pink Guava brings to the table, but the base on this is definitely sweeter and thicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOff-Flavors: Musky but not overbearing, probably a fit for the profile. Picks up some vegetal, almost cooling muddiness at higher percentages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThroat Hit: Light to moderate. Seems maybe a bit harsher than CAP Sweet Guava (if the maltol there doesn\u0026#39;t bug you) but not as harsh as something like FA Guava.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePercentage testing: At 1%, this doesn\u0026#39;t really feel solid enough for me. It\u0026#39;s a lighter flavor, with some guava sweetness, but it doesn\u0026#39;t feel all that rich and filled in. I\u0026#39;m still getting a bit of raw vg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 4%, this has filled in quite a bit. Feels fleshier, maybe a bit too thick to really feel juicy. Guava flavor is definitely heavier and sweeter than at 1%. Lighter muskiness and a bit of tartness that helps to freshen up the thicker base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 8%, the actual guava here doesn\u0026#39;t seem that different from 4%. Stickier mouthfeel and feels heavier and warmer. That musk is picking up, and I\u0026#39;m getting that sort vegetal finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m fairly new to this line, so I cast a wide net with these testers. Vape Train suggests a pretty wide range of \u0026quot;Mixed 3-7% - Standalone 5-8%.\u0026quot; Just based on these tests, I think that\u0026#39;s in the ballpark. I\u0026#39;d probably be on the low side of those recommendations, like 3% as an accent or 5-6% as a primary flavor. The core guava works okay at higher percentages, but the off notes start to pick up and get a bit weird at the high end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUses \u0026amp; Pairings: Pretty standard guava pairings. Should work well with stawberries or other tropical fruits. I\u0026#39;d be looking for something a bit brighter like passion fruit or pineapple, as the body on this already leans a bit heavy and sticky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith the passion fruit thing said, I don\u0026#39;t think this is the best option for a Pog Guava. I could see the stickiness of this flavor sort of amplifying the waxy thing that most orange flavors already have going on. I\u0026#39;d stick to zestier limes or grapefruits if you wanted to pair with citrus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProbably not the best choice for creams or custards, as those musky notes are going to stand out against a flatter, neutral base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWould work well in guava cocktail or beverage profiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecond Opinions: I can\u0026#39;t find anything solid out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#39;s the product page from Vape Train Australia.

Full Cotton Wicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTesting: Vape Train Light Rum, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 18 days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFlavor Description: A rum top note, but actually boozy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe rum here feels maybe a bit darker and sweeter than a white rum. I\u0026#39;d probably call it a golden rum or repasado if you\u0026#39;re feeling fancy. There\u0026#39;s a lighter fruity caramel type note as opposed to just hot booze like you\u0026#39;d get with a real light rum. Again, getting fancy, I\u0026#39;d try to spin as something like a sherry cask age as that fruitiness definitely has something vaguely grape-ish to it. Actually has a moderate booziness, giving a pretty clear impression of an alcohol while not being particularly aggressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRelatively top heavy flavor, with a whole lot more going on in the top notes than in the base of the flavor. Some sweeter, lightly caramel type body here but it\u0026#39;s pretty thin. Even at higher percentages, I\u0026#39;m still getting some of my testing mix coming through. Kind of unsatisfying as a single flavor rum vape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFairly thin overall, and you really only get some of those hotter rum notes and some sweetness in mixes. While not cloying by itself, it will definitely sweeten up a mix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOff-Flavors: Not a bunch of body here, maybe a bit sweet for a light rum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThroat Hit: Moderate, but it\u0026#39;s a booze and feels pretty appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePercentage testing: At 1%, this isn\u0026#39;t really working for me. More light, sweet fruitiness than a distinct rum note. Very thin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 4%, I\u0026#39;m getting a pretty solid sweet rum top note. Lightly fruity, with a light caramel body. Tastes boozy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 8% I\u0026#39;m really not getting any more booze than 4%. The body is just a bit thicker, but still feels a bit undersaturated and thin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-5% and using it standalone from 5-9%. Just based on these tests, I\u0026#39;d probably be using this around 4-5%. I\u0026#39;m not really getting a fuller rum or more satisfying booze effect than that higher. Definitely an accent flavor as a solo rum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUses \u0026amp; Pairings: Without any backup, this comes across like a splash of a fairly mellow rum in a cocktail mix. Using just the light rum, I\u0026#39;d wager you could get pretty close to a rum and coke or mojito where the rum isn\u0026#39;t really being pushed around by super aggressive fruity flavors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou know that thing where FA Jamaican Rum is delicious but not really boozy? Yeah, this fixes that. All of the rum\u0026#39;s I\u0026#39;ve tried so far don\u0026#39;t really have a pronounced booziness. This does, and it pretty much slots on top of darker, heavier rum flavors if thats your thing. Seriously, 4% of this on top of 2% FA Jamaican Rum and you\u0026#39;re basically in cocktail town. It may now be possible to make a boozy pina coloda. We talking mai tais, dark and stormies, hurricanes, daquiris... really, the sky is the limit here in terms of cocktail applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to go darker? Like a spiced rum? Starting adding some TPA Brown Sugar or FLV Caramel for some extra sweetness and depth on top of that FA Jamaican Rum and start adding in whatever spices you dig like cloves, cinnamon, and some extra vanilla. The hangover isn\u0026#39;t included.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn\u0026#39;t really be using this outside of cocktail applications.

Vape Train says this is their realistic lime, and it definitely hits some of those kind of notes. I get a pretty realistic lime zest in the top notes. Not overwhelming or too harsh, but manages to be fairly present, at least before a longer steep. There is also a fairly realistic lime tartness to this. I wouldn\u0026#39;t really call it fresh lime juice acidic, but the tartness adds some contrast and feels fairly realistic for something like a limeade. That tartness and zest plays off a sweeter, heavier base. Unsteeped, it\u0026#39;s a little less thick than FA Distilled Lime, but it also isn\u0026#39;t nearly as harsh. I think the base ends up sweet enough it kind of pulls this off a super realistic lime profile, but it\u0026#39;s pretty well balanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what would a citrus be without at least a little bit of weirdness in steeping? While this doesn\u0026#39;t completely fade out like some other lime flavors, it does seem to change a bit. Off a shake, this actually seems to have quite a bit of fairly realistic lime zest. It\u0026#39;s a bit thin, not terribly harsh, and reminds me a lot of a fuller version of FA Cold Pressed. Understandably, some of those really heavy zest notes start to die down with a steep. At about a week, I was still getting some zest but it was definitely a bit less aggressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis also seems to sweeten up considerably on a steep. At a week the uptick in sweetness was noticeable. At 16 days, it seems even sweeter and it\u0026#39;s pushing a bit towards a candy or limeade type flavor. It\u0026#39;s not that obnoxious bright \u0026quot;green\u0026quot; kind of skittles lime taste like something like FLV Lime, but more of a sweeter, heavier lime hard candy. Still has some pop and acidity like an actual lime, but it\u0026#39;s gotten heavier and kind of sugary. It\u0026#39;s kind of reminding me of a lime version of what some of the lemon flavors do where they basically turn into a lemonhead with a steep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to put this in some context, seems somewhere between the sweeter, brighter FA distilled lime and the more realistic FA Cold Press lime. As it steeps, it also picks up some of the sweetness of something like FW Key Lime or TPA Key Lime. It\u0026#39;s the utility infielder of the lime world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOff-Flavors: Nothing un-limeish. Seems to steep out considerably sweeter than it starts out, so that\u0026#39;s a bit odd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThroat Hit: Light. Pretty mellow for a lime or citrus in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePercentage testing: At 1%, especially steeped, I\u0026#39;m not getting a ton out of this. Some light tartness, some heavier candy sweetness, but it doesn\u0026#39;t really feel fleshed out or filled in at all. I\u0026#39;m tasting a bit of my base through this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 4%, this is starting to fill in. That lime zest is coming through a bit more,there is still some tartness, and that sweeter base is definitely deeper and more solid. Balance is fairly good here, and there isn\u0026#39;t much harshness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 8%, this doesn\u0026#39;t really feel blown out. The zest is a bit heavier but it isn\u0026#39;t too harsh and the base is feeling pretty heavily candied. While I\u0026#39;m getting most of what I want out the flavor, there isn\u0026#39;t really anything that makes me think this couldn\u0026#39;t comfortably go a bit higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVape Train suggests using this mixed 3-5% and standalone 6-9%. That actually doesn\u0026#39;t seem far off. It\u0026#39;s one of the least intense lime flavors I\u0026#39;ve had, especially with a steep. Just based on these tests, and if you\u0026#39;re planning on anything with a steep, I\u0026#39;d probably be using around 3-4% as an accent, and maybe 8% as a primary note but that seems flexible. As a S\u0026amp;V or short steep, I\u0026#39;d probably go at 4-5%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUses \u0026amp; Pairings: Kind of a catch-all lime. At lower percentages the zest and tartness are going to come through a bit easier than the sweeter parts of this. Should work well as a lime accent in stuff like fruit mixes or sweeter beverages. I think it\u0026#39;s probably a bit too sweet for really heavy cocktail applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eShould mix pretty well with heavier creams and custards in general, adding some decent lime flavor without coming across as too tart, bitter, or harsh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eShould also work in bakeries or cheesecakes, especially at higher percentages where that sweetness really comes out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecond Opinions: Noted had a big old lime fiesta recently and VT Persian Lime was covered. Starting at 54:50 the mighty ID10-T and some other jerk talk about this flavor. Selected quotes: \u0026quot;I dig this one.\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Better alternative to (FA) Distilled.\u0026quot; \u0026quot;lime zest up top, sort of that syrupy type base, less fizzy but a whole lot more limey than Distilled.\u0026quot; \u0026quot;not harsh at all.\u0026quot;\u003cbr\u003e\nHere is the product page from Vape Train. Their description: \u0026quot;Persian Lime has a real lime taste that’s sour just like a real lime, this flavour can be used and paired with other fruits such as Apricot, Banana, , Fig, Grapefruit, Guava, Lemon, Lychee, Orange, Mango, Papaya, Passion Fruit, Persimmon, Pineapple, Raspberry and Strawberry. Persian lime is also suitable for your alcohol beverage e-liquid recipes which may include Brandy, Cognac, Gin, Rum, Tequila \u0026amp; Vodka.\u0026quot; That is a whole lot of things. After a steep I\u0026#39;d quibble a bit about how realistic this comes across, but yeah... throw it in whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_raw":"Taken from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/824rdy/vape_train_persian_lime/) , by @concreteriver\r\n\r\nSetup: Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 12 wrap 24g 3.5mm SS316 @.31 ohms. 60w power, 450F temp limit.

As a S\u0026V or short steep, I'd probably go at 4-5%.\r\n\r\nUses \u0026 Pairings: Kind of a catch-all lime. At lower percentages the zest and tartness are going to come through a bit easier than the sweeter parts of this. Should work well as a lime accent in stuff like fruit mixes or sweeter beverages. I think it's probably a bit too sweet for really heavy cocktail applications.\r\n\r\nShould mix pretty well with heavier creams and custards in general, adding some decent lime flavor without coming across as too tart, bitter, or harsh.\r\n\r\nShould also work in bakeries or cheesecakes, especially at higher percentages where that sweetness really comes out.\r\n\r\nSecond Opinions: Noted had a big old lime fiesta recently and VT Persian Lime was covered. Starting at 54:50 the mighty ID10-T and some other jerk talk about this flavor. Selected quotes: \"I dig this one.\" \"Better alternative to (FA) Distilled.\" \"lime zest up top, sort of that syrupy type base, less fizzy but a whole lot more limey than Distilled.\" \"not harsh at all.\"\r\nHere is the product page from Vape Train. Their description: \"Persian Lime has a real lime taste that’s sour just like a real lime, this flavour can be used and paired with other fruits such as Apricot, Banana, , Fig, Grapefruit, Guava, Lemon, Lychee, Orange, Mango, Papaya, Passion Fruit, Persimmon, Pineapple, Raspberry and Strawberry. Persian lime is also suitable for your alcohol beverage e-liquid recipes which may include Brandy, Cognac, Gin, Rum, Tequila \u0026 Vodka.\" That is a whole lot of things. After a steep I'd quibble a bit about how realistic this comes across, but yeah... throw it in whatever.\r\n","short_description":"\u003cp\u003eA pretty well-rounded lime, mixing tartness, sweetness, and a bit of zest.\u003c/p\u003e\n","vendor_percentage":0.0,"vendor_description_raw":null,"vendor_description":null,"other_names":"","discontinued":false,"tags":{}},{"mix_id":2162921043422,"mix_sid":"rlmrce72","id":8943,"name":"Pineapple","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train","abbreviation":"VT","mix_id":2106391713496,"mix_sid":"qvnv8o2g"},"created_at":"2017-10-31T11:56:19.000-04:00","updated_at":"2018-12-17T03:34:10.000-05:00","deleted":null,"deleted_at":null,"recipe_count":4,"average_millipercent":2875,"slug":"vape-train-pineapple","confirmed":true,"rejected":false,"vendor_url":"https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/flavour-concentrates/vt-concentrates/pineapple-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-juice-recipe/","base":null,"density":1.0,"imageUrl":"","description":null,"description_raw":null,"short_description":null,"vendor_percentage":0.0,"vendor_description_raw":null,"vendor_description":null,"other_names":"","discontinued":false,"tags":{}},{"mix_id":2088954307383,"mix_sid":"qnnhgjef","id":8944,"name":"Pineapple Juice","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train","abbreviation":"VT","mix_id":2106391713496,"mix_sid":"qvnv8o2g"},"created_at":"2017-10-31T11:56:19.000-04:00","updated_at":"2019-06-14T21:23:01.000-04:00","deleted":null,"deleted_at":null,"recipe_count":27,"average_millipercent":2345,"slug":"vape-train-pineapple-juice","confirmed":true,"rejected":false,"vendor_url":"https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/flavour-concentrates/vt-concentrates/pineapple-juice-diy-flavour-concentrate-for-e-juice-making/","base":null,"density":1.0,"imageUrl":"","description":null,"description_raw":null,"short_description":null,"vendor_percentage":0.0,"vendor_description_raw":null,"vendor_description":null,"other_names":"","discontinued":false,"tags":{}}]
