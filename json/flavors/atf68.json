Tastes like an aggressively \u0026quot;red\u0026quot; candy. Capella themselves calls out red licorice and raspberry, and I could definitely see either of those. This does seem to have a bit more of a generic red licorice vibe than straight swedish fish. I also pick up something that tastes a lot like an artificial bright red cherry as an accent. Maybe missing just a light bit of tartness and deepness for an actual swedish fish, but it\u0026#39;s definitely recognizable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis actually has a pretty great mouthfeel. Very dense and chewy, with some of that sticky waxiness from actual swedish fish. Doesn\u0026#39;t feel like a straight ahead gummy candy, whatever they\u0026#39;re doing here mimics that half way between a jelly candy and gummy bear thing that actual swedish fish have. Isn\u0026#39;t a big chemical mess like most other candy texturizers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI do feel like this flavor could stand to be a bit more vibrant. It feels a bit muted overall, like the flavor feels just a half-step in the background and is a bit hazy through that texture. Might be fixable with some sweetener, but solo it feels like the flavor is struggling a bit against the texture here. It tastes like a swedish fish, but it doesn\u0026#39;t quite have that mouthwatering vibrancy of actual candy. Just cranking up the percentage doesn\u0026#39;t seem to help, as it just starts to push some off-notes to the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe only other explicit swedish fish flavor I\u0026#39;ve tried is TPA\u0026#39;s Swedish Gummy, and this seems to be a pretty big step up. This is noticeably less harsh and floral than the TPA Version, and the mouthfeel is quite a bit more like actual swedish fish. I feel like TPA\u0026#39;s version does the deeper part of the flavor a bit better, but 27 fishes is a whole lot more palatable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOff-flavors: While this definitely tastes \u0026quot;red\u0026quot; it probably has a bit too much of a cherry or red licorice vibe to really hit swedish fish outright, but it\u0026#39;s fairly close. The cherryish part of this gets a bit plasticy and chemical at higher percentages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThroat Hit: Light to moderate. Not as punchy as TPA Swedish Gummy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePercentage testing: I\u0026#39;m not getting too much out of this at 2%. Some light gummyish mouthfeel but not a lot of actual flavor. Pretty mellow down here, although the mouthfeel might be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 5% this is quite a bit more full.

Full Cotton Wicks.\r\n\r\nTesting: CAP SilverLine 27 Fishes, 2 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\r\n\r\nFlavor Description: A pretty solid, slightly muted Swedish Fish Flavor with a full mouthfeel.\r\n\r\nThe flavor here is definitely in the ballpark of swedish fish. Tastes like an aggressively \"red\" candy. Capella themselves calls out red licorice and raspberry, and I could definitely see either of those. This does seem to have a bit more of a generic red licorice vibe than straight swedish fish. I also pick up something that tastes a lot like an artificial bright red cherry as an accent. Maybe missing just a light bit of tartness and deepness for an actual swedish fish, but it's definitely recognizable.\r\n\r\nThis actually has a pretty great mouthfeel. Very dense and chewy, with some of that sticky waxiness from actual swedish fish. Doesn't feel like a straight ahead gummy candy, whatever they're doing here mimics that half way between a jelly candy and gummy bear thing that actual swedish fish have. Isn't a big chemical mess like most other candy texturizers.\r\n\r\nI do feel like this flavor could stand to be a bit more vibrant. It feels a bit muted overall, like the flavor feels just a half-step in the background and is a bit hazy through that texture. Might be fixable with some sweetener, but solo it feels like the flavor is struggling a bit against the texture here. It tastes like a swedish fish, but it doesn't quite have that mouthwatering vibrancy of actual candy. Just cranking up the percentage doesn't seem to help, as it just starts to push some off-notes to the front.\r\n\r\nThe only other explicit swedish fish flavor I've tried is TPA's Swedish Gummy, and this seems to be a pretty big step up. This is noticeably less harsh and floral than the TPA Version, and the mouthfeel is quite a bit more like actual swedish fish. I feel like TPA's version does the deeper part of the flavor a bit better, but 27 fishes is a whole lot more palatable.\r\n\r\nOff-flavors: While this definitely tastes \"red\" it probably has a bit too much of a cherry or red licorice vibe to really hit swedish fish outright, but it's fairly close. The cherryish part of this gets a bit plasticy and chemical at higher percentages.\r\n\r\nThroat Hit: Light to moderate. Not as punchy as TPA Swedish Gummy.\r\n\r\nPercentage testing: I'm not getting too much out of this at 2%. Some light gummyish mouthfeel but not a lot of actual flavor. Pretty mellow down here, although the mouthfeel might be useful.\r\n\r\nAt 5% this is quite a bit more full. I'm getting a relatively clear candy flavor out of this but it feels a little bit muted and in the background. There's some cherry off-notes creeping in around the edges but it isn't particulary harsh or plastic. Mouthfeel is pretty solid.\r\n\r\nTrying this a bit higher at 8% on a day steep, the flavor still feels a bit flat, but it is fuller. I'm getting more aggressive chemical off-notes but it's not awful for a bright candy flavor. Mouthfeel is legitimately sticky and full.\r\n\r\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably start around 3% as an accent flavor, primarily for mouthfeel.

It has some fairly convincing effervescence, more so than FW Pink Champagne and probably pushing up against FLV Root Beer in the fizz arms race. Definitely tastes light and sparkling. I\u0026#39;m actually getting some of that mineral twinge you get from champagne that isn\u0026#39;t straight prosecco. Light, but accurate, kind of booziness here.

It feels like a flatter, almost candy blood orange flavor instead of a tarter actual citrus. Does taste like the blood variety of orange flavor though, with a light bitterness to it offsetting at least a bit of that candied body.

Just based on these tests, I\u0026#39;d probably be around 7% as a solo flavor, 5% for a cocktail application where both the orange and champagne are going to work for you, and maybe 2-3% where you\u0026#39;re mostly trying to grab the texture and some orange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUses \u0026amp; Pairings: Cocktails, basically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou could the easy route, march in lock step with ID10-T and pair it up with FLV Morning Mimosa like in his \u0026quot;1-2-3 Sparkling Mimosa.\u0026quot; Congratulations mixers, he beat us all to the low hanging fruit. But we can go deeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to stay on the brunch theme, you could probably cover up some of that pronounced oranginess with a heavier peach flavor like JF Honey Peach or FLV Peach and get yourself a perfectly serviceable bellini. It\u0026#39;s going to be sweet, but brunch and all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#39;t think you\u0026#39;ll be able to mix around the orange, but you have some cocktail options where it can be slipped in fairly unobtrusively. You want to do a French 75? The orange in here could be bent toward a more generic citrus with some extra lemon. I\u0026#39;d say the cognac version would probably work a bit better, but this should work just fine with the gin version. I\u0026#39;d even say you could do a classic champagne cocktail and just don\u0026#39;t call attention to the fact you\u0026#39;re using orange instead of lemon. Add some INW Shisha Punch and you\u0026#39;re set to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStill not odd enough? I think the fizz in here could make a fairly effective cocktail texturizer, giving a thinner body to some pretty traditionally heavy and not really liquid-like alcohol flavors, especially with a light touch of cooling. That champagne flavor isn\u0026#39;t too aggressive and will be pretty easily masked by more aggressive and darker liquor flavors. Plus, a boatload of stuff uses orange liqueurs like Curacao, Grand Marnier, or even just chunks of oranges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDoes your old fashioned taste like an old fashioned hard candy? Lighten and brighten it up with some of this mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to go big and try to get a workable sazerac-esque cocktail with a spin like a Millionare? Try some of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s also pretty good solo if you\u0026#39;re into that sort of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecond Opinions: Noted literally just did an episode on Oranges. At 3:40, the mighty ID10-T has some notes on this one. Selected excerpts: \u0026quot;They ruined an amazing champagne flavor by adding blood orange flavor to it.\u0026quot; \u0026quot;It\u0026#39;s yummy, it\u0026#39;s not bad.\u0026quot; \u0026quot;super accurate champagne flavor\u0026quot; \u0026quot;not actual orange juice\u0026quot; \u0026quot;generic store brand 0 calorie sparkling water (type of orange)\u0026quot; ... and just for the record I\u0026#39;m pretty sure I coined the FLV Prison Wine term.

This is a fantastic unique flavour profile to lead the way into beverage and alcohol styled e-liquid recipes.

Add some INW Shisha Punch and you're set to go.\r\n\r\nStill not odd enough? I think the fizz in here could make a fairly effective cocktail texturizer, giving a thinner body to some pretty traditionally heavy and not really liquid-like alcohol flavors, especially with a light touch of cooling. That champagne flavor isn't too aggressive and will be pretty easily masked by more aggressive and darker liquor flavors. Plus, a boatload of stuff uses orange liqueurs like Curacao, Grand Marnier, or even just chunks of oranges.\r\n\r\nDoes your old fashioned taste like an old fashioned hard candy? Lighten and brighten it up with some of this mess.\r\n\r\nYou want to go big and try to get a workable sazerac-esque cocktail with a spin like a Millionare? Try some of this.\r\n\r\nIt's also pretty good solo if you're into that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nSecond Opinions: Noted literally just did an episode on Oranges. At 3:40, the mighty ID10-T has some notes on this one. Selected excerpts: \"They ruined an amazing champagne flavor by adding blood orange flavor to it.\" \"It's yummy, it's not bad.\" \"super accurate champagne flavor\" \"not actual orange juice\" \"generic store brand 0 calorie sparkling water (type of orange)\" ... and just for the record I'm pretty sure I coined the FLV Prison Wine term. Fite me.\r\n\r\nHere's the product page. Their description: \"bubbly champagne flavour with a dash of blood orange. This is a fantastic unique flavour profile to lead the way into beverage and alcohol styled e-liquid recipes. This flavours versatile to use, and lends a champagne like mouthfeel note that’s infused by a clean subtle citrus note from the blood orange. Great for making cocktail type recipes or adding depth to existing fruit or ejuice recipes. This flavour pairs well alcohol flavours such as vodka and almost every type of fruit and even candy recipes.\"\r\n","short_description":"\u003cp\u003eGreat champagne, fake-ish orange.

Not unduly harsh for the general level of booziness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePercentage testing: At 1%, at least with this kind of steep, I\u0026#39;m not getting much out of this. Slight booziness and a bit of sweetness. Nothing that really identifiably tastes like a whiskey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 4%, this is reading just a bit more like a whiskey. Still feels more like boozy top notes rather than a rich, robust full whiskey flavor. Light char, light sweetness, but really more just about that top-end booziness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 8%, this is definitely a little boozier, but still doesn\u0026#39;t feel like a full whiskey flavor. A bit sweeter, and lightly fruity. Char seems about unchanged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVape Train suggests a pretty wide range for this: 1-5% mixed, and 5-9% solo. Just based on these tests, I\u0026#39;d be using this as an accent flavor around 3-4%.

Should do largely the same thing without turning that scotch base over to bourbon. VT does have a scotch whiskey flavor that I\u0026#39;ll be testing later though, so it may not be your best option there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you did want to use this without whiskey backup, it could work for a lighter cocktail application like a (weaker tasting) whiskey and coke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis wouldn\u0026#39;t really be my choice for non-cocktail bourbon applications.

Full Cotton Wicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTesting: Vape Train Brandy, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 26 days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFlavor Description: Fruity and boozy brandy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSuprisingly accurate boozy note here. Actually has a medium brandy type heat, and tastes pretty well fermented and distilled. Sweeter brandy, tastes a bit cheap and funky overall, but hey it actually tastes like brandy. Some light oak barrel-ish astringency and just slightly tannic. Nothing that feels like a char though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is fairly fruity. I get a dark fermented grape note sticking out here. The sweetness makes it seem just a bit raisiny. Seems fairly appropriate for a brandy. I maybe pick up an errant hint of vanilla here or there, but it\u0026#39;s not overwhelming or distinct enough to be really distracting. Seems to have just a bit of an orange zest at the end of the vape as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike some of the other vape train boozes, this seems to be more than just a boozy top. There is some actual body in here. It\u0026#39;s not anywhere near thick or dense, but it does a serviceable job of conveying a fuller brandy flavor solo. Again, a bit on the sweet side, but not out of bounds for a brandy flavor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOff-Flavors: Tastes like a pretty cheap brandy, but nothing outside of the profile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThroat Hit: Moderate, but it\u0026#39;s pretty realistically boozy. Nothing unexpected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePercentage testing: At 1%, this is a bit odd. Still kind of fermented tasting, but not really boozy. Kind of a sour, fruity bubblegum kind of vibe. That grape is coming through pretty clear here. Lighter flavor overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 4%, definitely tastes more like a brandy and those boozy notes have filled in quite a bit. Still a bit fruity and sweet on balance, but that boozy top end sells the brandy thing fairly well. Seems a bit thin overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt 8%, this is a stronger, boozier brandy. That fruit seems more integrated with the liquor base and it\u0026#39;s picking up a kind of sugary, raisiny sweetness. Medium body and a boozy punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-5% or standalone at 5-8%. I actually like it quite a bit more on the high side, but it\u0026#39;s pretty aggressive and boozy. Just based on these tests, I\u0026#39;d be mixing with this around 3-4% as an accent, or 6% as a primary flavor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUses \u0026amp; Pairings: The heavy booziness here kind of limits the applications of this to cocktails.

Full Cotton Wicks.\r\n\r\nTesting: Vape Train Brandy, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 26 days.\r\n\r\nFlavor Description: Fruity and boozy brandy.\r\n\r\nSuprisingly accurate boozy note here. Actually has a medium brandy type heat, and tastes pretty well fermented and distilled. Sweeter brandy, tastes a bit cheap and funky overall, but hey it actually tastes like brandy. Some light oak barrel-ish astringency and just slightly tannic. Nothing that feels like a char though.\r\n\r\nThis is fairly fruity. I get a dark fermented grape note sticking out here. The sweetness makes it seem just a bit raisiny. Seems fairly appropriate for a brandy. I maybe pick up an errant hint of vanilla here or there, but it's not overwhelming or distinct enough to be really distracting. Seems to have just a bit of an orange zest at the end of the vape as well.\r\n\r\nUnlike some of the other vape train boozes, this seems to be more than just a boozy top. There is some actual body in here. It's not anywhere near thick or dense, but it does a serviceable job of conveying a fuller brandy flavor solo. Again, a bit on the sweet side, but not out of bounds for a brandy flavor.\r\n\r\nOff-Flavors: Tastes like a pretty cheap brandy, but nothing outside of the profile.\r\n\r\nThroat Hit: Moderate, but it's pretty realistically boozy. Nothing unexpected.\r\n\r\nPercentage testing: At 1%, this is a bit odd. Still kind of fermented tasting, but not really boozy. Kind of a sour, fruity bubblegum kind of vibe. That grape is coming through pretty clear here. Lighter flavor overall.\r\n\r\nAt 4%, definitely tastes more like a brandy and those boozy notes have filled in quite a bit. Still a bit fruity and sweet on balance, but that boozy top end sells the brandy thing fairly well. Seems a bit thin overall.\r\n\r\nAt 8%, this is a stronger, boozier brandy. That fruit seems more integrated with the liquor base and it's picking up a kind of sugary, raisiny sweetness. Medium body and a boozy punch.\r\n\r\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-5% or standalone at 5-8%. I actually like it quite a bit more on the high side, but it's pretty aggressive and boozy. Just based on these tests, I'd be mixing with this around 3-4% as an accent, or 6% as a primary flavor.\r\n\r\nUses \u0026 Pairings: The heavy booziness here kind of limits the applications of this to cocktails. In general, should pair pretty well with citrus, apples, pears, and stone fruit like plums and cherries. Could be interesting paired with FW Pink Champagne to pick up those grape fruity notes. Maybe a bit fruity for any real classic brandy cocktails, but I'd wager this wouldn't make a bad sidecar.\r\n\r\nThis is boozy and funky enough I'm not coming up with any real applications outside of cocktails.
